# justify_words_per_line

### Problem:
```
Given an array of strings and a count for max number of characters per line, 
return concatinated strings with appropriate amount of words with at least one 
space inbetween each word. If the concatinated strings do not meet the max line 
length including spaces, distribute the strings as evenly as possible between 
words. A valid string starts and ends with a non-space character. If the string 
contains a single string, spaces should be appended to it to create a string 
with the max length

Example:

Input: ["the", "quick", "brown", "fox", "jumps", "over", "the", "lazy", "dog"]
        16
Output: ["the  quick brown", "fox  jumps  over", "the   lazy   dog"]
```
